# Data

Metabolomics as well as clinical data for the Mayo Clinic cohorts are available via the AD Knowledge Portal. The AD Knowledge Portal is a platform for accessing data, analyses, and tools generated by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP-AD) Target Discovery Program and other National Institute on Aging (NIA)-supported programs to enable open-science practices and accelerate translational learning. The data, analyses, and tools are shared early in the research cycle without a publication embargo on a secondary use. Data is available for general research use according to the following requirements for data access and data attribution (https://adknowledgeportal.org/DataAccess/Instructions). For access to the metabolomics data used in this manuscript see: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn26446587
An interactive view of AD associations from this study can be found at https://krumsieklab.shinyapps.io/tauopathies/
